  # The Geo Data Portal
  
  Increasing complexity of natural resource management questions requires computations 
  involving a variety of data. The [USGS Geo Data Portal (GDP)](https://cida.usgs.gov/gdp/) 
  enables more efficient climate modeling and data acquisition to answer regional- or 
  national-scale questions by conducting data processing on the web. Web-enabled 
  processing has given researchers and managers access to powerful processing capabilities
  with minimal effort; thus, producing important modeling or decision support results for 
  nominal cost.
   
  The following will explain how the Geo Data Portal works.

  ### Bandwidth and processing savings with GDP
  
  The GDP moves computationally intensive processing steps from a researcher's computer to
  the web. This means researchers have more computational power available to them and 
  do not need to use their personal computers for lengthy and tedious processing tasks.
  
gdp_processing_after: >-
  
  This differs from traditional geoprocessing workflows which require download of an 
  massive amounts of data to be subset and processed. The GDP requires users to download only the 
  processed data.

  ### GDP algorithm support

  There are a number of built-in algorithms that take the gridded data and distill it. A common
  algorithm is to calculate the weighted average. The GDP will take the gridded dataset and for
  each timestep, it will average the data within the given spatial extent. The processed data will
  be a timeseries with one value for each timestep and for each spatial feature.

  In the figure above, a user is requesting monthly temperature data from January to August 2015 
  for a feature around Minnesota and Wisconsin. Each month has a grid of data associated with it 
  which is clipped to the spatial feature. Each clipped grid is then averaged, leaving one 
  value for each timestep.

  # Extreme Storm Transposition Use-case
  
  We are using an extreme storm transposition analysis to show the GDP in action. Storm
  transpositions are a "what-if" 
  [water resource planning tool](https://toolkit.climate.gov/case-studies/using-demonstration-storms-prepare-extreme-rainfall) where actual extreme rain 
  events are simulated in different locations. Water resource managers can use this method to evaluate
  the impact a storm with similar intensity would have on their city and then implement risk-reducing
  measures where they are needed. In this use-case, we are recreating the 
  [Potter et al](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1752-1688.12441/abstract)
  extreme storm transposition for a storm in 2008 that impacted Baraboo, WI and seeing how a storm of that
  magnitude might impact the Yahara River watershed near Madison. For this example, we are only going
  to find the cumulative precipitation, and not continue the analysis by using that value for flood modeling.

  ### Result of Storm Transposition

  Here is a visualization product showing the resulting cumulative precipitation from transposing the
  extreme storm from Baraboo to the Yahara River watershed.  
  
storm_transpose_after: >-
  
  The cumulative precipitation for both the original Yahara (7.6 in) and the transposed Yahara (10.4 in)
  were calculated, and are shown on the figure above. Transposing the storm north 24 miles resulted 
  in an increased of almost 3 inches of rain. 
  
  The storm dates were selected between June 2, 2008 to June 13, 2008. A shapefile of the Yahara River
  watershed was downloaded using the [National Water Census Data Portal](https://cida.usgs.gov/nwc/). To
  "transpose" the storm, the Yahara shapefile was first shifted north to the center of the extreme storm.
  This new spatial feature was used as input to the GDP, along with the storm start and end dates, and 
  the weighted average algorithm was used to process this data. A dataset of average precipitation 
  for each timestep was returned, and the cumulative sum calculated. The cumulative precipitation can now
  be used as input to flood models and other management tools to determine how this extreme storm could
  have impacted the Yahara (not covered here).
  
  The following will break down how the GDP processed this data.

  ### GDP Inputs - data
  
  For this analysis, we used precipitation data available in the "United States Stage 
  IV Quantitative Precipitation Archive" dataset from the GDP. The data are gridded and 
  have multiple timesteps. Below is an example of the gridded dataset before GDP processing.

  For simplicity, we are showing the gridded data by using a single timestep. The map below 
  shows the gridded data at 10:00 pm (UTC) on June 12, 2008.

  ### GDP Inputs - geometry
  
  The GDP summarizes the gridded data based on given geometries and algorithms. We transposed the
  Yahara River watershed north to where the most intense part of the 2008 storm. Using this as our
  spatial feature means that the GDP will be clipping the gridded dataset with the extreme storm 
  data captured in our Yahara-shaped feature.

  This figure shows the original and transposed Yahara River watershed. The watershed was 
  moved north by 24 miles.
  
yahara_precip_before: >-
  ### GDP Processing
  
  The real power of GDP is summarizing all of this data. For each timestep, the GDP clips the 
  data to the given geometry, and then "melts" the data for that geometry into one value based
  on your chosen algorithm. The result is one value per timestep per geometry, so in this 
  example, one value per timestep in the transposed Yahara watershed.
  
yahara_precip_after: >-
  
  The figure on the left shows the clipped gridded data for one timestep (10:00 pm (UTC) on June 
  12, 2008). The figure on the right shows the weighted average of that gridded data for this
  particular timestep.
  
conclusion: >-
  ### GDP Results
  
  Transposing the Yahara watershed north by 24 miles to capture the highest intensity of
  the 2008 storm resulted in an increase of 3 inches of rainfall. These precipitation 
  data could now be used in a watershed model, data visualization, or statistical 
  analysis, to calculate runoff and streamflow or evaluate the characteristics of the 
  storm. Any of these could also be compared between the storm that did occur over the 
  Yahara river and/or the transposed storm that could have occurred over the Yahara.
  
  # Other applications of GDP
  
  Results from the GDP can be used for any application that needs input data on a 
  per-polygon basis. Environmental modeling applications as well as data summaries 
  and visualizations can use GDP output with little to no additional processing. 
  Examples of analyses that have used the GDP include 
  [lake temperature modeling](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380014003664), 
  [surface water modeling](https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/209/2015/), and 
  [beach water quality modeling](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20135166).
