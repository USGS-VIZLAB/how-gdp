  # The Geo Data Portal
  
  Increasing complexity of natural resource management questions requires computations 
  involving a variety of data. The [USGS Geo Data Portal (GDP)](https://cida.usgs.gov/gdp/) 
  enables more efficient climate modeling and data acquisition to answer regional- or 
  national-scale questions by conducting data processing on the web. Web-enabled 
  processing has given researchers and managers access to powerful processing capabilities
  with minimal effort; thus, producing important modeling or decision support results for 
  nominal cost.
   
  The following will explain how the Geo Data Portal works.

  ### Bandwidth and processing savings with GDP
  
  The GDP moves computationally intensive processing steps from a researcher's computer to
  the web. This means researchers have more computational power at their fingertips, and 
  do not need to need their computer tied up during a lengthy processing step.

  This differs from traditional geoprocessing workflows which require downloads of an 
  immense amount of data to then process. The GDP requires users to download only the 
  processed data.

  # Extreme Storm Transposition Use-case
  
  We are using an extreme storm transposition analysis to show off how the GDP works. Storm
  transpositions are a "what-if" 
  [water resource planning tool](https://toolkit.climate.gov/case-studies/using-demonstration-storms-prepare-extreme-rainfall) where actual extreme rain 
  events are simulated in different locations. Water resource managers can use this method to evaluate
  the impact a storm with similar intensity would have on their city and then implement risk-reducing
  measures where they are needed. In this use-case, we are recreating the 
  [Potter et al](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1752-1688.12441/abstract)
  extreme storm transposition for a storm in 2008 that impacted Baraboo, WI and moving it to Madison, WI.

  Here is a visualization product showing the extreme storm transposition from Baraboo to
  Madison, Wisconsin.

  The data were selected and processed through the GDP. The following will break down how the 
  GDP processed the data. The resulting impact on the watershed is out of scope for this 
  visualization.

  ### GDP Inputs - data
  
  For this analysis, we will be looking at precipitation data. The data are gridded and have 
  multiple timesteps. Below is an animated map of the gridded data through time.

  ### GDP Inputs - geometry
  
  The GDP summarizes the gridded data based on given geometries and algorithms. We are looking
  at two different geometries - the Baraboo River watershed and the Yahara River watershed.

  ### GDP Processing
  
  The real power of GDP is summarizing all of this data. For each timestep, the GDP clips the 
  data to the given geometry, and then "melts" the data for that geometry into one value based
  on your chosen algorithm. The result is one value per timestep per geometry, so in this 
  example, one value per timestep in the Baraboo River watershed and one in the Yahara.
