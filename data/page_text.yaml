  # The Geo Data Portal
  
  Increasing complexity of natural resource management questions requires computations 
  involving a variety of data. The USGS Geo Data Portal (GDP) enables more efficient 
  climate modeling and data acquisition to answer regional- or national-scale questions 
  by conducting data processing on the web. Web-enabled processing has given researchers 
  and managers access to powerful processing capabilities with minimal effort; thus, 
  producing important modeling or decision support results for nominal cost.
   
  The following will explain how the Geo Data Portal works.

  ### GDP algorithm support

  Here is where I would type information about algorithm support and include a neat 
  [link](https://www.google.com/) to something.

  Here is some info about the pic.

  ### GDP Results
  
  What can you do with the processed data from GDP? Perform peak flow analyses (see potter?) 
  for more info. 
  
  # Other applications of GDP
  
  Also include information about other GDP applications.
